description: Analyze codebase and update project documentation (README, workflow)
---

1. Analyze that the project structure and features match the documentation by reading:
   - `src/` directory structure and file contents if necessary
   - `README.md`
   - `docs/workflow.md`

2. If there are discrepancies or new features not documented, update `README.md` and `docs/workflow.md` to reflect the current state of the project.

3. Notify the user of the changes made to the documentation.
